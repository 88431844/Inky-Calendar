### This file contains features in planning for the next release

# For version 1.4

## Main script

* Detect if there are network issues and restart the script automatically when online again
* Automatically backup the settings file and add script for updating

## Interfacing options
* Although it's simple to add personal data (iCal-URL, personal Openweathermap-api-key) since v1.3, it would be nice to have a simple webserver GUI where all of these details can be modified and reviewed.

* Another plan is to view the Error log from the webserver (ideal for debugging)

* Next, a feature to execute the script manually and display the output of the main script would be nice too.


If you have any suggestions or would like to discuss something, please use the 'improvement ideas' issue for that purpose.
